**{Handoff Title}**

{Description}

**Tasks:**
1. Task one

**Acceptance:**
- [ ] Criterion one

Blocked by: {dependency-handoff-id}

**Signals:**
- When starting: `<comware:handoff_start id="{handoff-id}">`
- When done: `<comware:handoff_complete id="{handoff-id}">`
- If blocked/failed: `<comware:handoff_failed id="{handoff-id}">`

### FINAL Handoff: `{sprint-prefix}-999-commit-verify` (P0, 0.5h)

**Commit, Verify CI, Update Goal Progress**

This handoff is MANDATORY. Do NOT skip it. Do NOT signal `<comware:done>` until CI is green and goal progress is updated.

**Tasks:**
1. Review all changes made during the sprint: `git status`
2. Stage all relevant files (avoid committing secrets or generated files)
3. Create commit with descriptive message summarizing sprint work
4. Push to remote branch: `git push origin <branch>`
5. Wait for CI and watch: `sleep 10 && gh run watch --exit-status`
6. If CI fails:
   - Read failure logs: `gh run view --log-failed`
   - Fix the failures (lint, type errors, test failures)
   - Commit the fix, push again: `git push origin <branch>`
   - Re-watch: `gh run watch --exit-status`
   - Repeat until CI is green
7. **Update goal progress in `.project/project.yaml`:**
   - Find the goal this sprint advances
   - Mark any newly satisfied `success_criteria` as `completed: true`
   - Recalculate `progress`: (completed / total) × 100
   - If all criteria complete, set goal `status: completed` and add `completed_date`

**Acceptance:**
- [ ] All sprint changes committed
- [ ] Commit message describes what was accomplished
- [ ] Changes pushed to remote
- [ ] CI pipeline passed (verified via: `gh run list --limit 1` shows success)
- [ ] No uncommitted work remains
- [ ] Goal success_criteria updated for any newly completed items
- [ ] Goal progress percentage recalculated

Blocked by: ALL preceding handoffs

**Signals:**
- When starting: `<comware:handoff_start id="{sprint-prefix}-999-commit-verify">`
- When done: `<comware:handoff_complete id="{sprint-prefix}-999-commit-verify">`
- If blocked: `<comware:handoff_failed id="{sprint-prefix}-999-commit-verify">`

## Completion

After ALL handoffs complete (including commit-verify):

1. Verify all acceptance criteria met
2. Verify CI is green
3. Signal completion:

```
<comware:done>
```
